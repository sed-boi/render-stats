# render-stats
 This Blender addon creates a lightweight HTTP server that maps your NAT via UPnP and supports IPv6/dualâ€‘stack connections. It serves a browser-friendly UI that displays live render statistics (current frame, total frames, progress, last frame time, etc.) along with a progress bar and a log console that aggregates messages from your render pipeline.
